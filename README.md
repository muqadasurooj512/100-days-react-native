# 100-days-react-native-cli
A 100-day React Native Cli challenge to build real UI and logic apps.

Welcome to my **100-day challenge** of building and learning with React Native Cli.  
This journey is focused on real-world mobile UI, animations, logic, navigation, and native features — 1 small project or screen **every day**.

> 🛠️ Using React Native CLI (not Expo) for deeper control and learning native integrations.
